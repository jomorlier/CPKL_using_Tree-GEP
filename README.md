# CPKL_using_Tree-GEP

Compositional Kernel Learning using Tree-based Genetic Programming (CPKL_Tree-GEP) for Gaussian Proecess Regression

The source codes in this repository are uploaded for the replication of results section.
The example for 

In order to see all results, you can plot the results via "Plot_results.m" for all numerical experiments in the folder of "0_Results".

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me: seungsab@gmail.com (Dr. Seung-Seop Jin).

Before you run the codes, you need the following MATLAB toolboxes.

Before you run the codes, you need the penalized toolbox [1]. You can download it from here: https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v072i06

And I extract some codes from the SURROGATES toolbox [2]. I also advice you to use this toolbox. You can download it from here: https://sites.google.com/site/srgtstoolbox/
